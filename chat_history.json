Here’s a quick overview:\n\n### **What is a Socket?**\nA **socket** is an endpoint for communication between two machines over a network. It’s a fundamental concept in networking, especially in **TCP/IP** and **UDP** protocols.\n\n### **Key Types of Sockets:**\n1. **TCP Sockets (Stream Sockets)**\n   - Reliable, connection-oriented (ensures data arrives in order).\n   - Used for web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), and file transfers (FTP).\n\n2. **UDP Sockets (Datagram Sockets)**\n   - Connectionless, faster but unreliable (no guarantee of delivery).\n   - Used for live streaming, DNS lookups, and online gaming.\n\n3. **Unix Domain Sockets**\n   - Used for **inter-process communication (IPC)** on the same machine (faster than TCP/IP).\n\n### **How Sockets Work:**\n- A **socket** is identified by an **IP address + port number** (e.g., `192.168.1.1:80`).\n- **Client-Server Model:**\n  - A **server** listens on a port (e.g., port `80` for HTTP).\n  - A **client** connects to the server using the IP and port.\n\n### **Example in Python (TCP Socket):**\n```python\n# Server\nimport socket\nserver_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\nserver_socket.bind(('127.0.0.1', 12345))\nserver_socket.listen(1)\nconn, addr = server_socket.accept()\nprint(f\"Connected by {addr}\")\ndata = conn.recv(1024)\nprint(f\"Received: {data.decode()}\")\nconn.close()\n\n# Client\nclient_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\nclient_socket.connect(('127.0.0.1', 12345))\nclient_socket.send(b\"Hello, Server!\")\nclient_socket.close()\n```\n\n### **Common Uses of Sockets:**\n- Web servers (Apache, Nginx)\n- Chat applications (IRC, WebSockets)\n- Game servers (Minecraft, multiplayer games)\n- APIs and microservices communication\n\nWould you like details on a specific type of socket or a programming example?
